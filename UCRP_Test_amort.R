# This script explores how to implement the amortization method in UCRP

# 

## Amortization before 7/1/2015 AV
# - Initial surpuls is amortized as a level dollar amount over 3 years.
# - UAAL identified prior to 7/1/2015 valuation:(before and not including, 14-15 plan year): any intial UAAL (after a period of surplus) or 
#   change in UAAL due to gains and losses(including contribution gains and losses) is amortized over 30 years. 
#
# - UAAL as of 2010:
#   Effective 7/1/2010ï¼Œ all UAAL amortization bases as of 7/1/2010 were combined and the combined bases is amortized as a level dollar amount 
#   over 30 years. 
# 
# - Implication for modeling: find the latest year when the plan had a surplus)


## Amortization after 7/1/2015 AV(including 2014-15 plan year)
#
# - Any initial UAAL (after a period of surplus) or change  in UAAL due to gains/losses(including contribution gains/losses) is amortized 
#   over 20 years.
# 
# Surplus:
#   - For any year in which UCRP has a surplus, such surplus would be amortized as a level dollar amount over 30 years, and all prior UAAL 
#     amortization bases would be considered fully amortized.
#   - (intial surplus amortized over 30 years accroding to (11)?)
#   - Changes in surplus after the effective date due to actuarial gains/losses(including contribution gains and losses) is amortized as a 
#     level dollar amount over 15 years. 



# Amortization rule in the model  
# 1. UAAL    -> Surplus: All prior amortization basis are considered fully amortized. Initial surplus is amortized over 30 years.
# 2. Surplus -> Surplus: change in surplus is amortized over 15 years.
# 3. Surplus -> UAAL:    All prior amortization basis are considered fully amortized. Initial UAAL is amortized over 20 years. 
# 4. UAAL    -> UAAL:    change in UAAL is amortized over 20 years.
